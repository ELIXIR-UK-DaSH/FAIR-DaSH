This short online course is suitable for researchers working with Life Science data, who would like to apply FAIR principles to their research outputs.
The course uses simple examples of how to make research data FAIR, providing direct guidance, as well as signposting to other more comprehensive FAIR data resources such as [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org), [FAIRcookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/home.html), [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org), and the [DSW Wizard]( https://ds-wizard.org).  Participants will be able to familiarise themselves with basic content and context, as well as being made aware of where to find additional guidance and training.
