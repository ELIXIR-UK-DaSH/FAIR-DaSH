## How to make data FAIR?

FAIR is a set of principles and not a scientific formula of a standard. Making the data more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable via the FAIR principles will hence vary between the projects. How to make data FAIR therefore does not prescribe a specific standard as other than the principles there is no established system of platforms and tools to inject FAIRness into human and machine agents. The common key channels leading to visibility of research, knowledge integration and material reuse however are good data management and stewardship. For ten principles for making your training material FAIR, [please follow this link](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854)
 
**Example**
1. Document FAIRification at data-level and project level and write a data management plan.
2.    Choose your file formats for data saving carefully.  
3.    Consider three types of metadata for the FAIRification: administrative, descriptive or citation metadata and structural metadata.
4.  Decide on who has access to your data, under which conditions and plan accordingly. Examples could be sensitive data or large files.
5.   Choose a persistent identifier/s (PID) for your digital resources such as Digital Object Identifier (DOI) referable to software and workflows. Providing your data and metadata with PID can be done by establishing a trusted repository. Both your raw and processed data will need a PID.
6.   Obtain a data licence like Creative Commons (CC) that will allow you keep the copyrights and share your data.

## Checklist for making FAIR
How FAIR are your data? Checklist CC-BY by Sarah Jones & Marjan Grootveld EUDAT

**Findable** 
- It should be possible for others to discover your data. Rich metadata should be available online in a researchable source, and the data should be assigned a persistent identifier. 
- A persistent identifier is assigned to your data
- There are rich metadata describing your data
- The metadata are online in a searchable source eg. a catalogue or data repository 
- The metadata record specifies the persistent identifier 

**Accessible**
- It should be possible for humans and machines to gain access to your data, under specific conditions or restrictions, where appropriate. FAIR does not mean that data need to be open! There should be metadata, even if the data is not accessible. 
- Following the persistent ID will take you to the data or associated metadata
- The protocol by which data can be retrieved follows recognised standards eg. http
- The access procedure includes authentication and authorisation steps, if necessary
- Metadata are accessible wherever possible, even if the data arenâ€™t 

**Interoperable**
- Data and metadata should conform to recognised formats and standards to allow them to be combined and exchanged.
- Data is provided in commonly understood and preferably open formats
- The metadata provided follows relevant standards
- Controlled vocabularies, keywords, thesauri or ontologies are used where possible
- Qualified references and links are provided to other related data 

**Reusable**
- Lots of documentation is needed to support data interpretation and reuse/ The data should conform to community norms and be clearly licensed so others know what kind of reuse are permitted. 
- The data are accurate and well described with many relevant attributes
- The data have clear and accessible data usage licence 
- It is clear why, how and by whom the data have been created and processed
- The data and metadata meet relevant domain standards

## Tools for making data FAIR
- There are several ongoing tool efforts covering the process of making data FAIR to include data management planning, production, evaluation and reusing of data. Some contribute to the development and design of FAIR platforms and infrastructures and some focus on specific FAIR elements.

**FAIR Micropublications**

Micropublication can refer to a number of terms. Invented by Eugene Power in 1990s, Microforms are reproduction of documents designed to be transmitted and stored.  One expression of micropublication is a book publishing under the expected revenue target. It also can mean a distribution technique aimed at particular micro market. Micropublishing in digital industry refers to publishing a short pieces of work such as reviews, articles on public websites. The purpose is sharing the content via digital content distribution such as email, search engines or social media.    

Before Internet, micropublishing did not have an important role in publishing due to high copying cost of relatively small pieces of work. Digital versions and e-readers such as Amazon or Apple changed this by giving better access to a number of co-authors and new authors debuting in the publishing industry.  
#### Examples of micropublication models in Biosciences
The smallest form of micropublication is only a statement with acknowledgments. One example is a nanopublication [see link](http://npmonitor.inn.ac) with the main aim of being computable. Nanopublications however are not human readable or easily interpretable without programming. The biggest type is a statement that comes with the significance, research questions, results and discussion. They can be a stand off metadata or included in publications and serialised. Please see the following link for an OWL 2 vocabulary for micropublications (http://purl.org/mp). In Biosciences they are important as simpler, statement-based works compatible with larger studies but being useful software tools they are also suitable in tractability of biomedical research.

### FAIRification and Micropublications
The use of micropublications in biomedical field is growing but still in the early stages. PLOS for instance (http://currents.plos.org) intends at dissemination of results by ways of shorter articles. Micropublications can be useful when the researchers do not FAIRify their data, hence do not share and deposit the findings in a way that other researcher can benefit from their results. Here Micropublications as a communication platform can capture and deliver data to information resource. It acts as a platform where researchers can publish their unpublished observations that is linked with metadata that is nevertheless peer-reviewed and suitable for citation.
The lack of sharing and poor findability stems from several reasons, rigorous and lengthy science journals, funding limitations or negative results. The hidden data can be shared therefore through Micropublication platform designed to enable researchers to directly submit their findings and publish as micropublication in line with FAIR principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible.
