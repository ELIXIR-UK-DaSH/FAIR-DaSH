> ## Check-in
> As we mentioned in the previous lesson, FAIR principles are important for the sustainability and openness of your research data. FAIR ensures that your data is 
> easily retrieved, shared, and reused.

# Benefits of FAIRness
#### Reusability of data assets
FAIRification of your data allows short- and long-term use of these data. Furthermore, the availability of these data allowed the implementation and testing of different predictive models. 
#### Cost savings
FAIR data saves not only time but also money spent on finding relevant data. Bear in mind, that it also helps researchers avoid duplicating experiments which will lower the costs and accelerate the research process. 
#### Time efficiency
FAIRification of your data will allow machine and human readability of your data. A and I of FAIR create a single point of access that saves time for researchers using and accessing your data. Machine readability ensures that research engines can find your data which will increase the visibility of your data

# Costs of not FAIRifying your data
Based on a report by the EU, not complying with FAIR principles have a detrimental effect at many levels: Research activities, Collaboration, and innovation. At each step of the data life cycle, there is a cost for not FAIRifying your data.

# What are misunderstandings of FAIR?

![FAIR data do not have to be open](../fig/Openfair.png)

There is a misconception that aligning with FAIR principles means your data has to be open. There are many examples where data can be FAIR but not open like sensitive data and any data subject to intellectual property. These data can still be FAIR and have controlled access. That's why the research community uses the phrase **“open as possible, closed as necessary”**
However, the research community strives to make the data as open as possible to allow the reproducibility of research results. There are a lot of methods that can be used to make your data FAIR and open. Different anonymization and controlled access techniques can be used to ensure the FAIRness of your data and yet your data is secure. These will be discussed in more detail in another lesson

# Examples of where data have been shared according to FAIR 
There are a lot of data shared according to FAIR. You will notice that each research community has its own recipes for FAIRification of data.
