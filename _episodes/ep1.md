With the current expansion of biomedical research data, there was an urgent need to develop guidelines to ensure proper data management. That's why FAIR principles were published to help researchers properly share, reuse, and manage their data. 

Also bear in mind that FAIR principles are not only applied to data but also to software, and workflows. They are easily adapted to different data types and more resources are now available on how to apply FAIR principles to different types of data, algorithms, tools, workflows, and software. 

In this lesson, we will explain FAIR principles and how FAIR principles will help you properly manage your data.

## What is FAIR?

> ## These principles were published in 
> Wilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, I. et al. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. Sci Data 3, 160018 (2016). 
> The FAIR publication of 2016 makes reference to the FAIR principles which are:
> - F stands for Findable 
> - A stands for Accessible 
> - I stands for Interoperable 
> - R stands for Reusable

To apply FAIR to your data, each principle has set of specific requirements that guide researchers through the process of FAIRification of their data to make their data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable.
### F in FAIR 
F is the first letter of FAIR, it indiactes findability. To make your data findable, the data should fulfil 4 principles. In this RDMBites, we will explain what are these principles

> ## Watch this RDMBites to know what are these Fs 
> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RwEVZC390wtxPQM-zQsBDT7IbNVq0wpZ/edit#slide=id.p2
> 
{: .callout}

> ## To recap
> To make your data **Findable**
> - F1: Metadata and data are assigned globally unique and persistent identifiers**
> - F2: Data are described with rich metadata
> - F3: Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe 
> - F4: Metadata and data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
{: .keypoints}

> ## Exercise
> After watching this videos, answer the following questions:
> - How many of these principles have you applied to your data?
> - What is metadata?
> - What are persistant identifiers?
> **Keep this in mind, we will need this for our next section on FAIRness of data**

### A in FAIR
A stands for accessibility to the data, this principle allows machine and human readability of your data. However, your data is still secure. As mentioned in Landi et al. **The “A” of FAIR – As Open as Possible, as Closed as Necessary** 

**To make your data comply with A, you need to apply two main principles**


> ## Watch this RDMBites to know what are these principles
> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ac0qF1IKIVH2kjGmXFbyH0WAqI2vXqUB/edit#slide=id.p1
> 
{: .callout}

> ## To recap
> To make your data **Accessible**
>- A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communication protocol
>- A1.1: The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
>- A1.2: The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization where necessary
>- A2: Metadata should be accessible even when the data is no longer available
>
{: .keypoints}

> ## Exercise
> After watching this videos, answer the following questions:
> - How many of these principles have you applied to your data?
> - What is protocol? Can you give an example?
> **Keep this in mind, we will need this for our next section on FAIRness of data**

### I in FAIR
I is related to technical interoperability. To understand more what this means, watch our RDMBites on I in FAIR

> ## Watch this video to know what is I in FAIR through different examples
> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15jRnCLWnjk-3klwRJBc5cQomfqu8BRdv/edit#slide=id.p2
> 
{: .callout}

> ## To recap
> To make your data **Interoperable**
>-	I1: (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation
>-	I2: (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles
>-	I3: (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
>
{: .keypoints}

> ## Exercise
> After watching this videos, answer the following questions:
> - How many of these principles have you applied to your data?
> - What are vocabularies? Can you give an example?
> **Keep this in mind, we will need this for our next section on FAIRness of data**
>

### R in FAIR
R indicates reusability and it is the last principle of FAIR. 

It included one main category that describes the importance of the use of well-descriptive metadata

- R1: (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

> ## Watch this video to know what is R in FAIR through different examples

## What is FAIRification of data?
It is a process of applying FAIR to your data. Your data will be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
This will be discussed later in detail


## What is FAIRness of data?
When you apply FAIR to your data, you can apply one or more of the principles. FAIRness describes how much your data fulfilled FAIR principles. Usually, you can use one of the assessment tools that will help you know and guide you on how to make your data more FAIR. This will be discussed later in detail.

# Benefits of FAIRness
#### Reusability of data assets
##### FAIRification of your data allows short- and long-term use of these data. Furthermore, the availability of these data allowed the implementation and testing of different predictive models. 
#### Cost savings
##### FAIR data saves not only time but also money spent on finding relevant data. Bear in mind, that it also helps researchers avoid duplicating experiments which will lower the costs and accelerate the research process. 
#### Time efficiency
##### FAIRification of your data will allow machine and human readability of your data. A and I of FAIR create a single point of access that saves time for researchers using and accessing your data. Machine readability ensures that research engines can find your data which will increase the visibility of your data
##### In addition to the aforementioned benefits, FAIR data allow reproducibility of research results because data are published with metadata and an analysis pipeline.

## Costs of not FAIRifying your data
##### Based on a report by the EU, not complying with FAIR principles have a detrimental effect at many levels: Research activities, Collaboration, and innovation. At each step of the data life cycle, there is a cost for not FAIRifying your data.

## What are misunderstandings of FAIR?

![FAIR data do not have to be open](../fig/Openfair.PNG)

> ## Important definitions
> - Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone
> - FAIR data is data that align with FAIR, data is **“open as possible, closed as necessary”**
> 
{: .keypoints}
##### There is a misconception that aligning with FAIR principles means your data has to be open. There are many examples where data can be FAIR but not open like sensitive data and any data subject to intellectual property. These data can still be FAIR and have controlled access. That's why the research community uses the phrase **“open as possible, closed as necessary”**
##### However, the research community strives to make the data as open as possible to allow the reproducibility of research results. There are a lot of methods that can be used to make your data FAIR and open. Different anonymization and controlled access techniques can be used to ensure the FAIRness of your data and yet your data is secure. These will be discussed in more detail in another lesson

## Examples of where data have been shared according to FAIR 
##### There are a lot of data shared according to FAIR. You will notice that each research community has its own recipes for FAIRification of data.
