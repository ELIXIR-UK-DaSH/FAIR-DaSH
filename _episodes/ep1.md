![FAIR principles](../fig/FAIR.jpg)

With the current expansion of biomedical research data, there was an urgent need to develop guidelines to ensure proper data management. That's why FAIR principles were published to help researchers properly share, reuse, and manage their data. 
Also bear in mind that FAIR principles are not only applied to data but also to software, and workflows. They are easily adapted to different data types and more resources are available on how to apply FAIR principles to different types of data, algorithms, tools, workflows, and software. 
In this lesson, we will explain FAIR principles and how FAIR principles will help you properly manage your data.

## What is FAIR?
The FAIR publication of 2016 makes reference to the FAIR principles which are:
- F stands for Findable 
- A stands for Accessible 
- I stands for Interoperable 
- R stands for Reusable 

These principles were published in 

Wilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, I. et al. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. Sci Data 3, 160018 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18

#### To apply FAIR to your data, each principles has set of specific requirements that guide researchers through the process of FAIRification of their data to make their data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable.

### F in FAIR 
F in FAIR includes 4 principles:

- F1: Metadata and data are assigned globally unique and persistent identifiers

- F2: Data are described with rich metadata

- F3: Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

- F4: Metadata and data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

Watch this video to know what is F in FAIR through different examples


### A in FAIR
A stands for accessibility to the data

A in FAIR includes 2 main principles:

- A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communication protocol

A1.1: The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

A1.2: The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization where necessary

- A2: Metadata should be accessible even when the data is no longer available

As mentioned in Landi et al. The “A” of FAIR – As Open as Possible, as Closed as Necessary 

Watch this video to know what is A in FAIR through different examples

### I in FAIR
I is related to technical interoperability 

These categories are: 

-	I1: (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation

-	I2: (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles

-	I3: (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

-	Watch this video to know what is i in FAIR through different examples

### R in FAIR
R indicates reusability which is the last principle of FAIR. 

It included one main category that describes the importance of the use of well-descriptive metadata

- R1: (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

Watch this video to know what is R in FAIR through different examples

## What is FAIRification?
It is a process of applying FAIR of your data. Your data will be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable.
This will be discussed later in details 

## What is FAIRness?
When you apply FAIR to your data, you can apply one or more of the principles. FAIRness describes how much your data fulfilled FAIR principles.
Usually you can use one of assessment tools that will help you know and guide you how to make your data more FAIR
This will be discussed later in details
