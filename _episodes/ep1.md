## What is FAIR?

The FAIR publication of 2016 makes reference to the FAIR principles where there are 4 categories 
- F stands for Findable 
- A stands for Accessible 
- I stands for Interoperable 
- R stands for Reusable 

These principles were published in 

Wilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, I. et al. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. Sci Data 3, 160018 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18

## Each principle has its own requirements
### F in FAIR 
F in FAIR includes 4 principles:

- F1: Metadata and data are assigned globally unique and persistent identifiers

- F2: Data are described with rich metadata

- F3: Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

- F4: Metadata and data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

### A in FAIR
A stands for accessibility to the data

A in FAIR includes 2 main principles:

- A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communication protocol

A1.1: The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

A1.2: The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization where necessary

- A2: Metadata should be accessible even when the data is no longer available

As mentioned in Landi et al. The “A” of FAIR – As Open as Possible, as Closed as Necessary 

### I in FAIR
I is related to technical interoperability 

These categories are: 

-	I1: (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation

-	I2: (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles

-	I3: (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

### R in FAIR
R indicates reusability which is the last principle of FAIR. 

It included one main category that describes the importance of the use of well-descriptive metadata

- R1: (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
