- How to FAIRify a piece of training FAIR? 
objectives:
- To be familiar with applying the FAIR principles to a training material 
- To recognise pros and cons of the training material FAIRification 
keypoints:
- Ten FAIR principles are applicable to a broad types of data, software and most training material. 
- Applying FAIR to the training material will optimise the reuse of data, increase visibility of research and add to > saving of time and money.

**Overview**
Implementing FAIR principles in the context of Bioinformatics training is useful if not necessary to assure your material meet the cornerstone of open science practices. Ten guiding steps set up around the principles are wide ranging and apply to data, software and all aspects of training material, from slide presentations to exercises. It is therefore advisable to plan your training material with FAIR principles in mind from the outset.Full set of guidelines listed below (FAIRification process) are designed to get you thinking about what you need to do although the degree and context of individual application will vary from project to project.

# FAIRification process

1. Share      
As obvious as it sounds, sharing your training material will make its purpose hence shape the Fairness. Think about who to share it with, how to share it and to what extent. 

> ## Example:
> A short online course aimed exclusively at departmental staff and shared on Github.  
> 
{: .challenge} 

2. Describe properly
Think about how the search engines will position your training material and what would aid clearer and faster find. 

> ## Example:
> Is the title accurately describing your project? Have you included relevant keywords?
> 
{: .challenge}  

3. Give unique identity
Think about what unique identifiers will help others citing your work and give you credit for building the training material.

> ## Example:
> Common identifiers such as URLs and Persistent identifiers like Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and ORCID.
> 
{: .challenge} 

4. Register online    
Think about a suitable training material repository where you can aggregate your data to be available to others. 

> ## Example:
>  For instance Elixir Tess or YouTube. 
{: .challenge} 

5. Define the access rules
Training material will vary according to for instance the sensitivity of data or paid memberships. 

> ## Example:
> Will it be full access or restricted access? Any restriction in access needs to be clear and simple and obvious to .> anyone searching for the data.
> 
{: .challenge} 
 
6. Use interoperable format
The format used will only depend on how widely is used but also how data should be shared and read.

> ## Example:
> Consider pros and cons of different formats, for instance PDF vs PowerPoint.
> 
{: .challenge} 

7. Make the material (re)usable for trainers
Think about what steps to take to allow your training material to be understood, reused and updated by other trainers. 

> ## Example:
> For instance, is your licence suitable for reuse? Is your material fully referenced?
>
{: .challenge}   

8. Make useable for trainees
Put your pedagogic hat on in planning your material long term and long distance. Think about overcoming potential barriers of the lack of face-to-face teaching. Put yourself in the shoes of a trainee is setting expectations. 

> ## Example:
> Are your aims clearly stated? Is your material clearly structured? Have you opened your channels for support and 
> feedback? 
>
{: .challenge}    
 
9. Welcome contributions
Think how to open your materials to others and state your principles of contribution. 

> ## Example: 
> For instance acknowledge the existing contributors and explain the merits to potential contributors.  
>
{: .challenge}

10. Keep materials up to date
Keep the track of your versions and update your data regularly. Therefore, be clear if your materials are still valid and if not state what is out of date.

> ## Example:
> Are you using the newest version? Have you stored previous copies securely? Are your references and links up to date?
>
{: .challenge}
